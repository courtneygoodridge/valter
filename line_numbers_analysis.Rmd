**Experiment description**

Participants are told that they are hackers that have stolen codes. The police want to crack the code but participants have to communicate codes to their lawyers without being caught.

**Control_SNARC** 

Participants shown just picture of the lawyers and a number. Participants have to respond with equivalent number (odd or even). 

**Lie_SNARC**

In the lie condition, sometimes the picture was the lawyer and other times it was the cop. When it was the cop, they had to lie (i.e. they had to repond with the opposite key. If the number was odd they had to respond as if it was even). 

In this lie condition, there are trials where the participant has to answer truthfully and also has to lie. 

**Understanding column names and data types**

Key: a = left key, g = right key 

Accuracy: 1 = correct, 0 = incorrect

Condition: controltrue = control condition (truth), exptrue = exp truth condition, explie = exp lie condition

In the **Control_SNARC**, they had a standard SNARC with context of being in court

In **Lie_SNARC** 2/3 trials were true (standard SNARC) whereas the 1/3 of trials participants had to lie.

*Notes on this section of the analysis*

*Line plots on left and right hand versus number responding to*
Line plots match the ones displayed by Valter

*Odd effect*
Unsure why Valter has done an ANOVA for testing the parity because there are only 2 factors (odd and even). Either way, it comes out as non-signifcant. I also prefer the mean points with error bars rather than with bar charts.

*2x2 ANOVA (parity x hand)*
My data set seems to have more participants than Valter's which might explain why my results are significant and his are not. I also prefer the line graphs to see the interaction.

*TO DO*

- Check if I'm importing data right - I can import data from one excel files from multiple sheets? (Yes I can, I just need to figure out how).
