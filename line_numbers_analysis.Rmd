## Decsciption and aim of this markdown

The aim of this markdown is replicate Valter's analysis of SNARC data using the R programming language. R provides a flexible way to analyse and visualise data. The markdown format allows for the analyse code to be separted into specific sections, and saved in html format. Before I continue into the analysis, I will remind both myself and Valter of the experiment:

## Experiment description - the context

Participants are told that they are hackers that have stolen codes. The police want to crack the code but participants have to communicate codes to their lawyers without being caught.

## Control_SNARC 

Participants shown just picture of the lawyer and a number. Participants have to respond with equivalent number (odd or even). This is the standard SNARC with context of being in a court.

## Lie_SNARC

In the lie condition, sometimes the picture is the lawyer and other times it is the cop. When it is the cop, they have to lie (i.e. repond with the opposite key, if the number is odd they had to respond as if it is  even). When the picture is a lawyer, they have to tell the truth (i.e. respond with the correct key). Here 2/3 trials are true (standard SNARC) whereas the 1/3 of trials participants had to lie (does this have any effect on the SNARC?)

## Understanding column names and data types from the raw data

Key: a = left key, g = right key 

Accuracy: 1 = correct, 0 = incorrect

## Loading packages

```{r echo = TRUE,  message = 'hide', warning = 'hide', results = 'hide'}
# rm(list = ls())

```

Above I am loading the packages that will be necessary for the analysis. Each package has specific utilities that will be needed to perform analysis. It is important to load them at the start of your script otherwise you will encounter errors.

## Loading data

```{r echo = TRUE, message = 'hide', warning = 'hide', results = 'hide'} 
# rm(list = ls()) clears environment
# dput(head(df,n)) provides example of data structure for stack overflow

# load control data
# set working directory on personal laptop
# setwd("C:/Users/Courtney/Documents/PhD/Valter")
setwd("C:/Users/pscmgo/OneDrive for Business/PhD/Project/Experiment_Code/valter/")

dat <- loadWorkbook("Data_Lie_Numbers_Clean.xlsx")
sheetNames <- sheets(dat)
for(i in 1:length(sheetNames)){
  assign(sheetNames[i], readWorkbook(dat, sheet = i))
}
```

Here I am loading the data. I set my working directory using the *setwd()* function, and then load in data from both sheets of the excel file.

## Renaming conditions

```{r}
# cleaning control condition
controldata <- Control_SNARC %>%
  dplyr::select(numbers, condition, key, accuracy, RTs, participant) %>%
  arrange(participant) %>%
  mutate(condition = "controltrue")

# cleaning experimental conditon
Lie_SNARC <- Lie_SNARC %>%
  dplyr::select(numbers, condition, key, accuracy, RTs, participant) %>%
  arrange(participant)

exptrue <- Lie_SNARC %>%
  dplyr::filter(condition == "t") %>%
  mutate(condition = "exptrue")

explie <- Lie_SNARC %>%
  dplyr::filter(condition == "l") %>%
  mutate(condition = "explie")

workingdata <- rbind(controldata, exptrue, explie)

```

**Control**

The piece of code above is mainly for my own benefit - I am just renaming conditions. From the *Control_SNARC* dataframe, I am selecting the important columns (numbers, condition, accuracy, RTs and participant), I then arrange them by participant, and then rename name the condition "controltrue". This indicates it was a control condition and subjects had to tell the truth. I name this new dataframe "controldata".

*Experimental*

I select the relevant columns in the Lie_SNARC condition and arrange by participant. I then create two dataframes: one containing trials where the subject was telling the truth (I rename this exptrue) and one containing trials where the subject was telling a lie (I rename this explie).

*Overview*

With these new condition names, I combine the three dataframes into one overall dataframe called workingdata. I will be using this for the analysis and visualisation.

## Creating handedness column

```{r}
# creating handedness variable
left <- workingdata %>%
  dplyr::filter(key == "a") %>%
  mutate(hand = "left")

right <- workingdata %>%
  dplyr::filter(key == "g") %>%
  mutate(hand = "right")

workingdata <- rbind(left, right)
```

Again, this is for my own benefit. I am creating a column to replace "key". The new column is called hand and denotes the left or right hand to make it easier to understand the dataframe. I filter each key type into it's own dataframe, create a new "hand" variable and then recombine the dataframe.

## Creating parity column

```{r}
# creating parity variable
even <- workingdata %>%
  dplyr::filter(numbers %% 2 == 0) %>%
  mutate(parity = "even")

odd <- workingdata %>%
  dplyr::filter(numbers %% 2 == 1) %>%
  mutate(parity = "odd")

workingdata <- rbind(even, odd)

rm(controldata, explie, exptrue, left, right, even, odd)
```

Fianlly, I filter the data into odd and even number dataframes. I then create a a parity column indicating whether the number is odd or even. I recombine the dataframe and remove the other dataframes from the global environment using the *rm()* function. We are now ready to visualise some data. 

## Overview so far

I have cleaned the data and set it up in a way I feel comfortable. The data manipulation so is really personal preference, but I will be using the variables/variables names for the rest of the analysis.

## Overview conditions - error per condition and mean RTs (replication of slide 2)

```{r}
# errors percentage 
ggplot(workingdata %>%
  dplyr::group_by(condition, accuracy) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(acc_num = n()) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::group_by(condition) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(perc = (acc_num / sum(acc_num)) * 100) %>%
  dplyr::filter(accuracy == 0), aes(x = condition, y = perc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(perc, 2),  vjust = -1)) +
  ylim(0, 15) +
  ylab("Percentage of errors (%)") +
  scale_x_discrete("Condition", labels = c("controltrue" = "Control", "explie" = "Police", "exptrue" = "Lawyer")) +
  ggtitle("Errors %") +
  theme_gray() 

# errors in each condition
ggplot(dplyr::filter(workingdata, accuracy == 0) %>%
         dplyr::group_by(condition) %>%
         dplyr::summarise(errors = n()), aes(x = condition, y = errors)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = errors, vjust = -1)) +
  ylim(0, 900) +
  ylab("Numbers of errors") +
  scale_x_discrete("Condition", labels = c("controltrue" = "Control", "explie" = "Police", "exptrue" = "Lawyer")) +
    ggtitle("Errors") +
  theme_gray() 

# mean RTS in each condition for correct repsonses
ggplot(dplyr::filter(workingdata, accuracy == 1) %>%
         dplyr::group_by(condition) %>%
         dplyr::summarise(meanRT = mean(RTs)), aes(x = condition, y = meanRT)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(meanRT, 2), vjust = -1)) +
  ylim(0, 1.2) +
  ylab("Mean reaction times (s)") +
  scale_x_discrete("Condition", labels = c("controltrue" = "Control", "explie" = "Police", "exptrue" = "Lawyer")) +
  ggtitle("Mean RT") +
  theme_gray() 
```

The above code computes the graphs for slide 2 in the presentation that you sent to me (and that I sent back to you). The graphs visualise:

- Number of errors per condition (more errors in the condition where the police officer was present)
- Percentage of errors per condition (higher percentageof errors where the police officer was present)
- Mean reaction time per conditon (fasted RTs for the control condition i.e. no pictures, just standard SNARC)

I have tried to recreate the original graphs as closely as possible in order for you to see that it is possible to make these graphs in R. I have titled them as you have in the presentation to make it easier to which graph relates to which. 

## Control condition RTs (lawyer only) - MARC effect (replication of slide 3)

```{r}
# line graph demonstrating RTs over each number subjects were given
ggplot(data = workingdata %>%
         dplyr::filter(condition == "controltrue") %>%
         dplyr::group_by(numbers, hand) %>%
         dplyr::summarise(meanRT = mean(RTs)), aes(x = numbers, y = meanRT, col = hand)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous("Numbers", breaks = seq(0, 9, 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Mean RT (s)", breaks = seq(0, 0.62, 0.02)) +
  ggtitle("RTs for left and right hands across numbers")

# bar charts (with 95% confidence intervals) showing RTs for odd and even numbers
OddEffect <- workingdata %>%
  dplyr::filter(condition == "controltrue")

CI_OddEffect <- summarySE(OddEffect, measurevar = "RTs", groupvars = c("parity"))

ggplot(CI_OddEffect, aes(x = parity, y = RTs)) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = RTs - ci, ymax = RTs + ci), width = .1) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(0.55, 0.60) +
  ggtitle("Odd effect")

### NEED TO SORT THIS
t.test(RTs ~ parity, data = OddEffect)
### NEED TO SORT THIS

# MARC effect bar chart (with 95% confidence intervals) for parity x hand - shows interaction
lawyeronly <- workingdata %>%
  dplyr::filter(condition == "controltrue")

result_MARC <- ezANOVA(lawyeronly, dv = RTs, wid = participant, within = .(parity, hand), type = 3, detailed = TRUE, return_aov = TRUE)
result_MARC

eta_sq(result_MARC$aov, partial = TRUE)

CIerror_bar_MARC <- summarySE(lawyeronly, measurevar = "RTs", groupvars = c("parity", "hand"))

ggplot(data = CIerror_bar_MARC, aes(x = parity, color = hand, group = hand, y = RTs)) +
         stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point") +
         stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "line") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = RTs - ci, ymax = RTs + ci), width = .1) +
  ggtitle("MARC")

```

This code chunk aims to replicate slide 3 of the summary analysis. The results of the t-test and ANOVA slightly differ, however by looking at the degrees of freedom is looks like this could due to different numbers of participants when you originally analysed the data.

**Line graph**

Line graph represents the mean reaction times for each hand (left and right) for various numbers in the control condition. I'm unsure what we expect here - whether the right hand is faster for numbers on the right side of the number line (5-9, and vice versa for left) or whether the left is faster for odd numbers and the right is faster for even numbers. Either way, the line graph matches the example.

**95% CIs plot for odd effect**

The 95% CIs match the example. Mean RTs a different however the confidence intervals overalp. I perform a t-test to compare the 2 means (I'm unsure why in the example an f value is computed instead of  t value). Either way, it comes out as non-signifcant. I also prefer the mean points with error bars rather than with bar charts.

**T-test for the odd effect**

TO DO

**2x2 factorial ANOVA**

The results demonstrate no significant main effects but there is a significant interaction (large effect size). This appears to be standard MARC effect i.e. RTs are faster when the parity and hand you respond are congruent (even with right, odd with left). 

**TO DO**
COMPUTE T-TEST WITH CORRECT NUMBER OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM.

## Control condition RTs (lawyer only) - SNARC effect (replication of slide 4)

```{r}
# creating magnitude variable
small <- lawyeronly %>%
  dplyr::filter(numbers <= 4) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(magnitude = "small")

large <- lawyeronly %>%
  dplyr::filter(numbers > 4) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(magnitude = "large")

lawyeronly <- rbind(small, large)

# SNARC effect ANOVA

result_SNARC <- ezANOVA(lawyeronly, dv = RTs, wid = participant, within = .(magnitude, hand), type = 3, detailed = TRUE, return_aov = TRUE)
result_SNARC

eta_sq(result_SNARC$aov, partial = TRUE)


CIerror_bar_SNARC <- summarySE(lawyeronly, measurevar = "RTs", groupvars = c("magnitude", "hand"))

ggplot(data = CIerror_bar_SNARC, aes(x = magnitude, color = hand, group = hand, y = RTs)) +
         stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point") +
         stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "line") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = RTs - ci, ymax = RTs + ci), width = .1) +
  ggtitle("SNARC")

# regression plot

lawyeronly$numbers <- as.numeric(lawyeronly$numbers)

ggplot(data = lawyeronly %>%
         dplyr::group_by(numbers) %>%
         dplyr::summarise(m = mean(RTs)), aes(x = numbers, y = m)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 9, 1), limits = c(1, 9)) +
  ggtitle("Linear model of number magnitude and RTs") +
  xlab("Numbers (magnitude)") +
  ylab("mean reaction time (s)")
```

Firstly I make dataframes *small* and *large* in order to compute a new variable called magnitude. This will be used (alongside hand) to analyse the SNARC effect

**2x2 factorial ANOVA**

Significant main effect of magnitude (smaller number reacted to faster) however more importantly, a significant interatcion with large effect size. This indicates a classic SNARC in the only lawyer control condition (i.e. when responding to larger numbers with right hard, RTs are faster. When responding to small numbers with left hand, RTs are faster). 

**Regression (linear model)**

I was a litte bit confused about the regression here. On slide 4, it appears you plot the number magnitudes against differences in reaction times for the SNARC effect? I have plotted the number magnitudes against average reaction times which is slightly different. Happy to have another go once I understand what the regression in slide 4 is trying to show.

##  Control condition errors (lawyer only) - (replication of slide 5)

```{r}
# Odd effect
ggplot(lawyeronly %>%
         dplyr::group_by(parity) %>%
         dplyr::summarise(mean_acc = mean(accuracy)) %>%
         dplyr::mutate(per_acc = mean_acc * 100), aes(x = parity, y = per_acc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ylab("Numbers of errors") +
  scale_x_discrete("Parity", labels = c("odd" = "Odd", "even" = "Even")) +
  ggtitle("Odd effect - number of errors") +
  theme_gray() 

model <- glm(accuracy ~ parity,
             data = lawyeronly,
             family = binomial)

summary(model)
```

**Odd effect error analysis**

To perform the error analysis, I utilise a logistic GLM. Accuracy is a dichotomous dependent variable and thus the ssumptions of a standard ANOVA will be violated. Hence a logistic GLM can be used to model an event that exists in a pass/fail, correct/error state, such as accuracy in this case.

The logistic GLM indicates a significant main effect of parity via the object *parityodd*. The estimate output is negative, suggesting that the odd parity significantly reduces the probability of an accurate response. Plotting errors in a bar chart visualises this - odd parity has a lower accuracy percentage. 

##  Control condition errors (lawyer only) - MARC effect error analysis (replication of slide 5)

```{r}
# MARC effect for errors/accuracy
lawyeronly$hand = factor(lawyeronly$hand, levels = c("right", "left"))
lawyeronly$parity = factor(lawyeronly$parity, levels = c("even", "odd"))

model <- glm(accuracy ~ hand * parity + participant,
             data = lawyeronly,
             family=binomial)
summary(model)

lawyeronly %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(hand, parity) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(mean_acc = mean(accuracy))

MARC_errors <- summarySE(lawyeronly, measurevar = "accuracy", groupvars = c("parity", "hand"))

ggplot(data = MARC_errors, aes(x = parity, color = hand, group = hand, y = accuracy)) +
         stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point") +
         stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "line") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = accuracy - ci, ymax = accuracy + ci), width = .1) +
  ylab("Response accuracy (%)") +
  xlab("Parity") +
  ggtitle("MARC effect - error analysis")
```

**Error analysis of the MARC effect**

Once again, I implement a logistic GLM. First I set up my factors for hand and parity. I then  run a generalised linear model and specify the family as binomial. This allows me to compute the logistic regression.

The results of the logistic regression demonstrate a significant interaction. By looking at the average accuracy percentage of each parity/hand pair, we can see what is driving the interaction. The output suggests that when compared to another pairing, the *handleft:parityodd* pairing significantly reduces the probability of an accurate response. Intuitively this seems to be the opposite of the traditional MARC effect (higher accuracy when parity and hand are congruant). Thus I implement a line plot to visualise the significant interaction.

The line plot visualises this interaction. Accuracy is reduced for left + odd pairs and right + even pairs. This is the opposite of the traditional MARC effect. 

##  Control condition errors (lawyer only) - SNARC effect error analysis (replication of slide 5)

```{r}
# SNARC effect for errors/accuracy
lawyeronly$hand = factor(lawyeronly$hand, levels = c("right", "left"))
lawyeronly$magnitude = factor(lawyeronly$magnitude, levels = c("small", "large"))

model <- glm(accuracy ~ hand * magnitude + participant,
             data = lawyeronly,
             family = binomial)
summary(model)

lawyeronly %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(hand, magnitude) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(mean_acc = mean(accuracy))

SNARC_errors <- summarySE(lawyeronly, measurevar = "accuracy", groupvars = c("magnitude", "hand"))

ggplot(data = SNARC_errors, aes(x = magnitude, color = hand, group = hand, y = accuracy)) +
         stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point") +
         stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "line") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = accuracy - ci, ymax = accuracy + ci), width = .1) +
  ylab("Response accuracy (%)") +
  xlab("Magnitude") +
  ggtitle("SNARC effect - error analysis")
```

**Error analysis of the SNARC effect**

Once again, I compute a logistic regression which results in a significant interaction. 

The *handleft:magnitudelarge* pairing estimate suggests that when compared against another pairing, the probability of an accurate response increases. Intuitively this seems to be the opposite of the traditional SNARC effect (lower accuracy when magnitude and hand are incongruant). Thus I implement a line plot to visualise the significant interaction.

The line plot visualises this interaction. Accuracy is reduced for left + small pairs and right + large pairs. This is the opposite of the traditional SNARC effect.

**Overview**

Logistic regression analysis matches the analysis on slide 5. Despite matching, I believe I have used a more appropriate analyse techniques given the nature of the data (dichotomous variables).
